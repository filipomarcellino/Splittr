// approach:
// query the database and put entire array of object data from database to an end point
// then depending on what component needs to show what, i can then pass specific pieces of data into that component and then show it in the component by calling specific parts of the array of objets and only render the parts of each object that i need
// this all renders in the dashboard.js component
